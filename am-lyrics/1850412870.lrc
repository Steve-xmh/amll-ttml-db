[01:20.014]Woo-woo-woo
[01:34.399]Ah, ah, ah-aah
[01:37.900]Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, aah
[02:00.362]Oh, as gardens grow
[02:03.857]Beauty
[02:07.432]After the end of time
[02:10.579]In the melted frost and rime
[02:27.291]Hue tomorrow's heights, to tomorrow's life
[02:29.971]I'll walk in step beside you
[02:35.904]Thaw winter's rime anew
[02:38.998]Woven memories your boon
[02:44.614]And like a melody, sing our reverie
