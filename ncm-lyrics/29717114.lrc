[00:22.806]Needed someone to save me, Needed someone to hug me
[00:24.635]Needed a whole world but nobody would love me
[00:26.482]And I learned from this that people wanna buck me
[00:28.396]And I've learned from this, to put no one above me
[00:30.174]I said I can't take it I know I'm gonna make it
[00:31.846]I know I'm not normal but I gotta fake it
[00:33.752]I swear I'm not cocky, I am just confident

[01:39.286]I didn't choose this life it was destiny
[01:41.176]God tested me to find the best of me
[01:43.029]And I know I'm going to make it even without a degree
[01:44.810]Cause the test scores don't mean shit to me
[01:46.744]And when you said that I would fail it didn't get to me
[01:48.605]Now I'm begging, public masses, please

[01:55.737]Cause I am not about that, I just wanna love
[01:57.615]I just wanna grow, I just wanna learn
[01:59.302]The passion, it burns to write this music
[02:01.363]I'm so late that I just might lose it
[02:03.228]But don't ever confuse it, it's all so worth it
[02:05.144]I just wanna help hip-hop, not hurt it
[02:06.956]And as for my style I don't know how to word it
[02:08.790]Why do you even have to categorize me?
[02:10.557]Fuck it let 'em hate, let 'em all despise me
[02:12.454]Cause I'm gonna take this, flip it up and make this
[02:14.244]Something that the whole word cannot imagine
[02:16.217]Let alone fathom I'm from another planet
[02:17.807]I swear I'm not manic, listen to me dammit
